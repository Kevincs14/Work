(sereno community) the homes next to mine are only 10' apart. if a fire were to catch in this area it would destroy about 30-40 homes in this immediate strip of land that is overgrown, not to mention the possibility of igniting other homes. given this is our dry season, and what has happened in los angeles i'd like to see action taken to get the overgrowth back under control and maintained. there have also been recent 'bonfires' created in the undeveloped part of our neighborhood (and apparently abandoned where residents had to go out and extinguish it themselves.) i have brought this overgrowth issue to the attention of sereno's hoa, breeze, for a year and a half, and no action has been taken. they initially said the responsibility belonged to the new home owners behind me. however, not one of them has taken action after so-called 'violation letters allegedly mailed to each'. i find it hard to believe that not one resident took action if this were true. i challenge the ownership and responsibility. i believe its the responsibility of the hoa because the 10' land is between the property stake at the back of my lot, and another stake is/was about 10' from it, suggesting that marked the back of the lot of the neighbors located behind me. i also believe its a safety hazard, that the developer installed a very long, above ground, so-called ""irrigation pipe and valves' along this same strip of land not maintained. and that 'irrigation' never worked as it did not have pressure to account for the distance (according to another neighbor who spoke with the developer's foreman). if someone tripped over it they could be seriously injured --its not very visible with the overgrowth. last i cannot imagine the snakes, rodents, and other animals that have made this area their 'home' so close to mine. would you please help ensure the irrigation system is removed or fixed, and that the overgrowth is addressed and consistently maintained by our hoa, breeze, or each of the responsible homeowners on windmill forge, if that is the case. brenda godfrey, 734.233.4087",

TAMPA FL 33613 *",TAMPA SUNSCAPE INC,"i noticed mold growing on the walls behind a bin in my apartment pantry as well as a brownish color on the bathroom walls around the mirror back at the end of october. on 10/28/24 i put in a maintenance request which included pictures. the head maintenance guy ricard came to clean it with bleach and 'killz"" and then painted over the area in the pantry and bathroom. by the next week i had to put in another request as the mold was back more aggressive in the pantry and the bathroom. i took a better look around the kitchen and bathroom and started to notice the baseboards were no longer white and were turning color as if mold is growing there as well. we moved in late july on the 25th so i know the baseboards could not be changing color due to everyday living for only 2 months. the request was handled with mildew remover and ""killz"" on 11/7/24. within a few days it was right back, growing all over my food and utensils so i had to throw everything away in the pantry. in the bathroom i noticed the wall behind the toilet had a brown spot on the white wall looking like the baseboards and from then i knew there had to be a bigger issue going on as to where the growth was coming from. under the bathroom sink my personal items have black specks all on them from whatever is growing under the counter. i called the office to speak with a manager about the issue and was told she is only in on tuesday and thursdays. i went to the office thursday 11/14/24 instead of inputting another maintenace request to speak with the property and/or leasing manager who was not there, so i informed the from office lady alicia of the ongoing issue that keeps coming back after being ""cleaned"". alicia informed me that they would probably have to get a specialist out to check for mold because richard (head maintenace guy) was saying it is not mold and that she would inform the manager to reach out. they sent richard back for a 3rd time to bleach and paint the area along with another worker. i pointed out the wetness i noticed behind the toilet to the other worker before he left. the next day 11/15/24 unexpectedly a plumbing company knocks on my door saying they are here to look at the issue in the bathroom, the office gave them the green light to cut open and break down walls to which they found a broken pipe behind the bathroom mirror. the company fixed the pipe i assume, and they had an agreement with the office to leave black trash bags to cover the opening in the wall and ceiling. i was told the wall needed to dry and then richard would be back to patch the drywall come monday since they are off on weekends. monday came around and nothing was done, that was the same week as thanksgiving, so they were closed from thursday to monday 11/25. due to work i was not able to visit the office in person again until 11/27/24, i spoke to alicia again in the office, i told her i have pictures and videos of the apartment and asked if the manager can reach out as nothing is being done, this is a major issue that cannot just be patched up with mold in several places of the apartment. putting up dry wall over a whole is not going to solve the issue and we cannot live in an apartment like this. she asked me to email her the phots and videos. the videos are too large, so i sent over pictures of everything and every spot i noticed was problematic: the pantry, baseboards, under kitchen sink, under bathroom sink, behind the toilet, behind the bathroom counter as well as the bathroom baseboards. along with the photos i asked for the manager to reach out again, as well as asking what can be done as my partner, and i cannot live like this. we have gotten no calls or emails in return. they just sent richard to come clean the pantry, i told him no and to come back once the main job was done. this would be his 4th or 5th doing the same thing to the pantry that is only going to come back as soon as he leaves and doesn't make sense if nothing else is being fixed. no other mention",

Gibsonton FL 33534 *",MILE HIGH TL BORROWER 1 INCOME LLC,"my name is josh, 1 of 4 tenants at 12127 fox bloom ave, gibsonton, fl 33534. i rent through the company progress residential. we moved into this home on 10/25/2024 and have had issues with the home and the prominent issue is the mold in this home. before leasing this home i was able to conduct a tour of this home before leasing this home and had some concerns about the home. evidence 2, labeled below, will go over the concerns we had before renting the property. one keynote to make now is i never mentioned mold as a concern in any emails or calls i made over the phone. part of the walkthrough i noticed that some walls were discolored, some a darker white due to work done already and slightly brown/yellow, in the washer and dryer room specifically. i was told by david, the representative that i was working with at the time, that the home was previously lived in. there would be cosmetic damage but as long as it’s “livable and usable” it would be fine to rent and that progress didn’t fix those “cosmetic concerns” without a fee. as i did the walk through, any concern was either cosmetic or hygienic concerns. another aspect to keep in mind, i am moving during a time where both helen and milton just passed a few days to a week. i was checking water structural concerts like broken/leaking roof etc. besides the mention of mildew, which could be interpreted as having high moisture in a home, due to two hurricanes, water damage, internally, was not a concern. i do have videos of the walkthrough to show that the leak was already happening before moving in and the progression of it getting worse. the first warning sign was when nelson came to the house, more details mentioned below, and he was there to fix the sliding backdoor. i never called in about mold, to note. once he fixed that, the 2nd time and 100%, he said something like in my notes i also see you may have an issue with a__. he said a 3 letter acronym, starting with an a, never heard it before. i told him, “i don’t know what you are speaking of”. he went to say, “i am not supposed to say it but, mold?” i explained i had no idea what he was talking about and he said there were concerns with mold in the drawers, which i didn’t know about. i told him he can have a look and check for himself. he pointed out one cabinet, 4th image below, and said, “this is what they might have been talking about but it just looks like the cabinet has a water stain and hasn’t been repainted”. i didn’t think much of it at this time, my main concern at that point was my back sliding door was compromised for 3-5 days, and anyone could slide the door open and come in. we did add wood to the door so no one could open it. from there we had other issues, emergency issues, but the mold is my biggest concern and priority that hasn’t been resolved, as of 12/16 as of 9pm est, as i type this email. from the day we moved to 12/9, the mold, which is being tested and i highly believe is black mold, hasn’t been addressed. around the beginning of dec i found water damage/mold, a sock dropped on the side of the washer and i notice this “cosmetic” damage is now double the original size. i touch the brown/yellow/black spotted wall and it indents with my touch. at that point i know mold and water damage is occurring. i call to get this concern escalated, as i have asthma, and both my sister and i have immune systems that can be easily compromised. i get tested once a year for lupus, as it runs through my mother’s side of the family and about 2 years ago i thought symptoms were arising. it was confirmed that i have the marker present for lupus, a higher possibility that it can be expressed at any time. i check once a year to make sure i am up to date on my health. when i called in to get this resolved, i am constantly met with no one wanting to fix the issue or stating that when they patch the hole, then they would remove it. below are images of the mold, the mold test i did and other concerns.",

Brandon FL 33511 *",2017-2 IH BORROWER LP,"summary of concerns regarding mold issues at my property i am submitting this summary to formally document my concerns regarding my property management company's delayed response in addressing mold issues stemming from a leaking roof and a wet electrical outlet. the unresolved issues have significantly impacted my living conditions and, more importantly, my child's health and well-being. initial reporting of the outlet issue (9/7/2024): on september 7, 2024, i reported a wet electrical outlet issue. a technician was sent to seal the exterior of a window, but the outlet continued to get wet whenever it rained. the problem persisted and eventually led to mold growth around the outlet. roof leaks and escalation of mold concerns (10/2/2024 - 10/5/2024): on october 2, 2024, i reported multiple roof leaks, including leaks from the skylights. on october 3, 2024, when a technician came to assess the property, i emphasized that the outlet issue had worsened, with the outlet remaining wet and mold growing. i also informed them that the skylights were holding moisture, and mold was spreading rapidly. on october 5, 2024, i submitted another work order in writing, specifically addressing the growing mold issue. roofing contractors' recommendations: since my reports, the property management company has sent three different roofing contractors to evaluate the situation. all contractors unanimously recommended replacing the faulty roof as the solution to the ongoing leaks and moisture issues. health concerns and lack of action: despite my repeated calls to invitation homes since october 5, 2024, and urgent requests for action, i have been consistently told that the company is ""waiting for permits or hoa approval"" to proceed with the necessary repairs. the delays have caused significant distress, as my son has been experiencing respiratory health issues due to the unchecked mold growth in the home. impact on my family: this ongoing issue is directly impacting my son's health and wellness. the mold growth in our home has created an unsafe living environment, and the lack of timely action by the property management company is unacceptable. the delays and lack of resolution to replace the roof, fix the leaks, and properly address the mold problem need to be rectified immediately. request for assistance: i respectfully request the code enforcement agency to intervene and ensure the property management company takes immediate and appropriate action to resolve these issues. my family cannot continue to live in these conditions while waiting indefinitely for permits or hoa approval. thank you for your attention to this matter. please feel free to contact me for any further details or documentation.",

(sereno community) the homes next to mine are only 10' apart. if a fire were to catch in this area it would destroy about 30-40 homes in this immediate strip of land that is overgrown, not to mention the possibility of igniting other homes. given this is our dry season, and what has happened in los angeles i'd like to see action taken to get the overgrowth back under control and maintained. there have also been recent 'bonfires' created in the undeveloped part of our neighborhood (and apparently abandoned where residents had to go out and extinguish it themselves.) i have brought this overgrowth issue to the attention of sereno's hoa, breeze, for a year and a half, and no action has been taken. they initially said the responsibility belonged to the new home owners behind me. however, not one of them has taken action after so-called 'violation letters allegedly mailed to each'. i find it hard to believe that not one resident took action if this were true. i challenge the ownership and responsibility. i believe its the responsibility of the hoa because the 10' land is between the property stake at the back of my lot, and another stake is/was about 10' from it, suggesting that marked the back of the lot of the neighbors located behind me. i also believe its a safety hazard, that the developer installed a very long, above ground, so-called ""irrigation pipe and valves' along this same strip of land not maintained. and that 'irrigation' never worked as it did not have pressure to account for the distance (according to another neighbor who spoke with the developer's foreman). if someone tripped over it they could be seriously injured --its not very visible with the overgrowth. last i cannot imagine the snakes, rodents, and other animals that have made this area their 'home' so close to mine. would you please help ensure the irrigation system is removed or fixed, and that the overgrowth is addressed and consistently maintained by our hoa, breeze, or each of the responsible homeowners on windmill forge, if that is the case. brenda godfrey, 734.233.4087",
